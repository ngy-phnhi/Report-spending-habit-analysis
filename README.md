# 💰 Actual Spending Behavior Analysis

This project presents an interactive dashboard focused on analyzing **personal financial behavior** over the course of 5 years (2020–2024). It leverages real spending and income data to uncover insights into saving habits, essential vs. non-essential expenditures, and monthly financial trends.

## 📌 Objective
To understand individual spending patterns, assess savings behavior, and identify areas for better financial planning.

## 🛠 Tools & Techniques
- **Tableau** (Visualization)
- **Calculated Fields** to compute:
  - Saving
  - Spending transaction rates
  - Repeat category rates
  - Expense classification (essential vs. non-essential)
  - Convert type

## 📊 Dashboard Features
- **Income vs. Expense KPIs** (with monthly trends)
- **Net Saving Status** (dynamic over time)
- **Spending Structure** pie chart
- **Spending & Saving Overview** bar chart
- **Category Breakdown** with filters
- **Monthly Expense Trend Line**
- **Repeat Category Rate** KPI (habitual behavior insight)

## 🔍 Key Insights & Recommendation

Despite a total income of **$883,141** over five years, the user incurred **a net loss of nearly $195,000**, driven by consistently overspending.  
Average **monthly deficit exceeds $3,250**, indicating a pressing need for better cash flow management.

### Main Observations:
- **Spending exceeds income in most months (2020–2024)**
  - Only ~18% of months recorded positive savings.
  - Suggests a persistent imbalance in income-expenditure ratio.

- **Unstable savings behavior**
  - Savings fluctuate irregularly across time periods.
  - Indicates a lack of budgeting discipline or monitoring tools.

- **Over 99% repeat category rate**
  - Spending decisions are highly habitual.
  - Points to behavioral patterns rather than occasional surges.

- **Non-essential expenses dominate**
  - Categories like Travel, Shopping, and Food & Drink take up significant proportions.
  - Essential expenses account for less than 40% in most months.

### 💡 Recommendation to Management:
Consider implementing a **personal finance monitoring system** with:
- Alerts when monthly spending exceeds income.
- Visual tracking of net savings and monthly deficits.
- Highlighting high-repeat expense categories for behavioral awareness.
- Setting savings targets with feedback indicators.
Such actions can guide users or employees toward **more sustainable financial behaviors**, reduce long-term risks, and foster a data-informed culture of financial responsibility.
